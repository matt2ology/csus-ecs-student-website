				<h2>What I’m Doing Now</h2>
				<P>
					I’m Sac-State student, majoring in Computer Science, I try to live a balanced work and school life. My girlfriend, and best-friend,
					Judy encourages and supports me every step of the way. This is what I spend my time doing:
				</P>
				<ul>
					<li>Reading books</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Currently: </strong> Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin
							<ul>
								<li> ISBN-13: 978-0132350884
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Building a personal website (this one)</li>
					<li>Improving my photography and coding skills</li>
					<li>Saving kittens from burning buildings</li>
					<li>Trying to become Hokage someday <img src="images/gifs/naruto-running.gif" alt="Naruto running sprite" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></li> 
				</ul>

				<h2>These are my main priorities right now</h2>
				<p>
					I am open to considering new opportunities, while attending Sac State and afterwards, for I am always looking to learn and
					develop a better perspective of new things. I aspire to stick to my priorities 90% of the time, as a result; I will
					say no to the majority of requests that come my way now. If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update
					this page to reflect those changes. Last update was March 9, 2018. Inspired by
					<a href="https://sivers.org/now" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>,
					<a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com" target="_blank">Thomas Frank</a>, and
					<a href="https://salferrarello.com/about/" target="_blank">Sal Ferrarello</a>, this page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself that goals only become meaningful if
					work is put into its completion.
